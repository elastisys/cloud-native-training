# Kubernetes and Cloud Native for Application Developers

## Course overview

Is your company under pressure to deliver software features frequently and predictably with minimal downtime?
Do you require help on how to adopt Kubernetes to increase development velocity and efficiency?
Then this is the course for you!

The course is aligned with the Linux Foundation’s 3 day course [Kubernetes for App Developers (LFD459)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-app-developers/), which Elastisys also teaches separately. The course covers the knowledge domains tested by the [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) (CKAD) exam, substantially increasing students’ ability to become certified if they want to.
