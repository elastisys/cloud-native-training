# Kubernetes and Cloud Native for Application Developers

## Course overview

Is your company under pressure to deliver software features frequently and predictably with minimal downtime?
Do you require help on how to adopt Kubernetes to increase development velocity and efficiency?
Then this is the course for you!

The course is aligned with the Linux Foundation’s 3 day course [Kubernetes for App Developers (LFD459)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-app-developers/), which Elastisys also teaches separately. The course covers the knowledge domains tested by the [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) (CKAD) exam, substantially increasing students’ ability to become certified if they want to. 

## Target audience

This training is suitable for developers and operations teams that want to get a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts and how to develop applications to make best use of a Kubernetes based infrastructure.

## Format

The training offers a hands-on experience with the most popular Cloud Native technologies application developers need to know such as Docker, Kubernetes (minikube and kubectl), Helm, Grafana and Flux to gain the benefits of Kubernetes.

## Duration

A full day.
